# Examples

The `ballerinax/hubspot.crm.object.contacts` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios.

1. [Email-Advertising](./Email-Advertising/) - Unsubscribe and remove customers based on email addresses of CSV-imported data..
2. [Event-Registration](./Event-Registration/) - Event registration and follow-up using CSV-imported data.

## Prerequisites

1. Generate HubSpot credentials to authenticate the connector as described in the [Setup guide](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.object.contacts/blob/main/README.md#setup-guide).

2. For each example, create a `Config.toml` file with the related configuration. Below is an example of how your `Config.toml` file should be structured:

    ```toml
    [auth]
    clientId = "<Client Id>"
    clientSecret =  "<Client Secret>"
    refreshToken = "<Refresh Token>"
    credentialBearer =  "POST_BODY_BEARER"
    ```


## Running an example

Execute the following commands to build an example from the source:

* To build an example:

    ```bash
    bal build
    ```

* To run an example:

    ```bash
    bal run
    ```

## Building the examples with the local module

**Warning**: Due to the absence of support for reading local repositories for single Ballerina files, the Bala of the module is manually written to the central repository as a workaround. Consequently, the bash script may modify your local Ballerina repositories.

Execute the following commands to build all the examples against the changes you have made to the module locally:

* To build all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh build
    ```

* To run all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh run
    ```
